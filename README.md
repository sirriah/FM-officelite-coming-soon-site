# Frontend Mentor - Officelite coming soon site

![Design preview for the Officelite coming soon site coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


This is my solution of Officelite coming soon site challenge. I finished index page and now I am working on sign-up page. I hope you will like it!

I really enjoyed this challenge. I think that it helped me to learn more about form components. I feel that JavaScript is still little bit painful for me but I hope that it will be better with next challeges :).

This project is made with:
- HTML
- CSS (SCSS)
- JS
